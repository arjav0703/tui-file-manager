# TUI File Manager (WIP)

This is a simple TUI (terminal user interface) file manager built with Rust. It aims to provide a lightweight and efficient way to navigate and manage files directly from the terminal.

## Keyboard Functions
- `q`: Quit the application
- `j or ⬇️`: Move down
- `k or ⬆️`: Move up
- `h or ⬅️`: Go to parent directory
- `l or ➡️`: Enter the selected directory
- `d`: Delete the selected file or directory
- `ENTER` : Open the selected file with the default system application (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows)
